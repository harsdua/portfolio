I am a Canadian finishing my <a href="https://www.ulb.be/en/programme/ba-info-1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Bachelors of Computer Science at the ULB </a> in Belgium. 
<br />
 When I encountered mathematical problems in my final year of highschool that needed programming, I instantly fell in love with it. It was at this moment that I knew I wanted to pursue a career within the domain of computer science. I also had a passion for the French language. I figured pursuing my B.CS in French would allow me to become fluent, while equipping me with the needed skills for
a career in CS. 
<br />
I chose to go to Belgium, since it was the only place where I could do my degree in French, without proving that I was fluent in French. I had attained fluency within the first 2 months of my program. 
<br />
I am now in my final year, and hope to work anywhere in Belgium or Canada upon graduation as a software developer or anything related. I am also currently learning Dutch and hope to be fluent before 2024.
